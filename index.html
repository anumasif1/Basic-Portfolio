    My name is Anum. 
    I moved from Pakistan to California in 2015 and since then, I have lived in Irvine as a homemaker.
    I am 27 years old, have a 2 year old son "Haziq" and a supporting husband "Farjad". 
    I am currently a student of Coding Bootcamp at
    University of California Irvine. Web development and programming
    is new to me. It's challenging at whole lot level but, this is 
    something I enjoy doing. I completed my graduate studies in Anthropology 
    and I have worked for non-profit/multi-national organizations for over 2 
    years. I have always been an extrovert and enjoyed working with diverse teams. 
    Although, my professional experience and educational background is different 
    from my current career path, I believe that the soft and hard skills I have learnt 
    will be a huge add on to my work.
